# Medical Complications Prediction using Machine Learning

This project involves the analysis of medical data from 1700 patients to predict complications related to Myocardial Infarction (MI). The goal is to develop a predictive model based on patient information, leveraging Python and various machine learning techniques. The project includes data cleaning, exploration, interpretation, and the application of regression and classification algorithms to produce a final model.

## Results
This project focused on discerning key indicators for the early detection of severe Myocardial Infarction (MI), aiming to improve intervention strategies. Through comprehensive analysis, we identified two significant factors: angina symptoms and elevated white blood cell counts.

  1. Angina Symptoms as a Pivotal Indicator
The findings underscored the pivotal role of angina symptoms in predicting severe MI. Patients presenting with angina demonstrated a heightened likelihood of severe cardiac events. The correlation between angina symptoms and the severity of MI was robust.

  2. Elevated White Blood Cell Counts as an Indicator of Severity
Elevated white blood cell counts emerged as another robust indicator of severe MI. The association between elevated white blood cell counts and the severity of MI was notable, suggesting an inflammatory response associated with the condition. 

## Model Performance
The predictive model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%. This indicates the reliability and effectiveness of the identified indicators in forecasting severe MI cases. The high accuracy underscores the potential clinical utility of our findings for early intervention and patient management.
