# Medical Complications Prediction using Machine Learning

This project involves the analysis of medical data from 1700 patients to predict complications related to Myocardial Infarction (MI). The goal is to develop a predictive model based on patient information, leveraging Python and various machine learning techniques. The project includes data cleaning, exploration, interpretation, and the application of regression and classification algorithms to produce a final model.
